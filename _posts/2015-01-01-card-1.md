<a href="http://www.actcat.co.jp/" target="_blank">Actcat</a> is making a code reviewing service called <a href="https://sideci.com/" target="_blank">SideCI</a>, and supporting engineers to write clean and maintainable code. I'm currently working as a product designer, and work full-time from my place in Canada.
